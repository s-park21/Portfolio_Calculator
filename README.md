Portfolio calculator collects stock data from yfinance to calculate financial indicators

Installation:
`pip install -r dependencies.txt`
This only seems to work effectively in an Anaconda environment however, it is not the only option.

Usage:
Most of the calculations are performed in the Stocks.py class.
Pass the class a params.yaml file containing all of the required data for the portfolio calculations.
See example_portfolio.yaml for reference

Example:
Refer to Multi_asset_portfolio_calculator.ipynb
